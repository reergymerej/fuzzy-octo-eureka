Let's play with types.


There is a lot of redundancy here.  How can I get them to reuse some of the same
functions?

We can inject the function that transforms the values in the map call.  The type
variable will ensure that the transform function and the list items we provide
have the same type.


## install
```
yarn
```

## start
```
yarn start
# open http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm
```
